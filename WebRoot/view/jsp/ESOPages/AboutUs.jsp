	<h3 class="head-color visible-xs">Hippocratic Theory</h3>
	<p class="textcolor_gy">Hippocrates is credited with being the first physician to reject superstitions and beliefs that credited supernatural or divine forces with causing illness. Hippocrates was credited by the disciples of Pythagoras of allying philosophy and medicine. He separated the discipline of medicine from religion, believing and arguing that disease was not a punishment inflicted by the gods but rather the product of environmental factors, diet and living habits. Indeed there is not a single mention of a mystical illness in the entirety of the Hippocratic Corpus.</p>

	<p class="textcolor_gy">However,Hippocrates did work with many convictions that were based on what is now known to be incorrect anatomy and physiology, such as Humorism.</p>
	<p class="textcolor_gy">Ancient Greek schools of medicine were split (into the Knidian and Koan) on how to deal with disease. The Knidian school of medicine focused on diagnosis, but was dependent on many faulty assumptions about the human body: Greek medicine at the time of Hippocrates knew almost nothing of human anatomy and physiology because of the Greek taboo forbidding the dissection of humans. The Knidian school consequently failed to distinguish when one disease caused many possible series of symptoms. The Hippocratic school or Koan school achieved greater success by applying general diagnoses and passive treatments. Its focus was on patient care and prognosis, not diagnosis. It could effectively treat diseases and allowed for a great development in clinical practice.</p>

	<p class="textcolor_gy">Hippocratic medicine and its philosophy are far removed from that of modern medicine. Now, the physician focuses on specific diagnosis and specialized treatment, both of which were espoused by the Knidian school. This shift in medical thought since Hippocrates' day has caused serious debate over the past two millennia.</p>

	<p class="textcolor_gy"><b>We believe that symptoms are the body's way of telling you that something is wrong or out of balance.  If you treat the symptom(s), the body will just create another issue as a way to communicate it's need for help.  However, if you find and treat the root cause, the symptoms will subside or be alleviated altogether.  As the number of side effects and questions rise from new pharmaceutical drugs on the market, we believe that going back to basics and better information will help us live longer, more productive lives.</b></p>

	<div class="col-md-9 col-sm-8">
		<p class="textcolor_gy mg_lrm15">When I was 13 years old, my grandmother was sent home to die. She had been treated for many ailments through the years and tried every method that her doctors suggested: surgeries, medications, therapy, etc. But they were at the end of their usefulness.... and she was at the end of the road. Her primary diagnoses were hemophilia and Crohn's Disease but she could hardly eat anything and slept over 22 hours a day.</p>
		<p class="textcolor_gy mg_lrm15">Out of sheer desperation, my grandfather, unwilling to give up, searched for options and stumbled across a friend of a friend who's wife had a similar experience. They had gone to a clinic in Tia Juana, Mexico and she had a full recovery. So for my grandma, even though it was a long shot, it was better than the alternative. So, my grandparents immediately left Denver, CO and rushed to Tia Juana for this "experimental, non-FDA" approved treatment. The clinic discovered that my Grandma had been misdiagnosed and consequently incorrectly treated for years. She had some food allergies, and many toxins built up in her body. In fact, the doctor told her that the medications she had been taking were actually killing her. They did a full detox treatment and she went home after just one week. That treatment saved her life! In fact, it gave her 12 more years with an amazing quality of life.</p>
		<p class="textcolor_gy mg_lrm15">Fast forward more than 20 years later...to today... that clinic is still saving lives, and yet still considered "experimental" and unknown to most people. And yet more and more folks in the U.S. are struggling with their health, trying to find answers, dealing with multiple diagnoses, misdiagnoses, trying different medications and battling the side effects, all the while hoping for better outcomes. The good news is, that clinic is just one option out of the thousands of alternatives that eSecondOpinion provides.</p>

			 <p><strong>Thank God for eSecondOpinion.com!</strong> When I went in to the doctor, they said that I only had one option for treatment... even when I begged to explore the alternatives. Then I found eSO and found out that there are over a dozen options for my condition and all of them were plant-based. What a relief!</p>

			 <p><strong>Thanks to eSO,</strong> I found an option that slowed the progression of cataracts in my dog. The vet wanted $4,000 for cataract surgery with a huge risk that she wouldn't survive due to her tiny size and age. The drops that I found is what Europeans use all the time for pets and people for their eye health... and it cost pennies compared to the alternative! Thanks eSO!</p>

			 <p><strong>After speaking with several doctors,</strong> nurses, and dermatologists over 10 months, I had several diagnoses, including seborrhoric dermatitis, rosacea, allergies, and even lupus. The doctors' only solution was biweekly cortisone shots, antibiotics, and a daily pill that only kept some symptoms at bay as long as I didn't miss any doses. My symptoms included a terrible itch from head to groin; rashes and redness on my face, hands, and scalp; extremely dry, white flaky skin on my eyelids and scalp, and losing hair by the handfuls. Fortunately, eSecondOpinion helped me find a unique specialist who gave me specific supplements and told me to avoid certain foods for a while. After only one month, all of my itching stopped and the rash disappeared. Now I feel empowered to control my own health and, by following his simple recommendations, the itching is completely gone.</p>
